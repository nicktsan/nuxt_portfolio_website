## Solving the Deck Building Dilemma for Cookie Run: Braverse Fans

As a passionate fan of Cookie Run: Braverse, I’ve encountered a recurring issue: the game lacks an official English release. This creates a significant barrier for Western players who rely on fan translations to navigate the game and build their decks. Moreover, there are no English deck-building websites for Cookie Run: Braverse, leaving players without convenient tools to share or copy deck lists. This is the problem I aim to solve with my project—a comprehensive deck-building website that supports both English and Hangul, offering much-needed tools like card searching, deck exporting, and browsing other players' decks.

### Why I Joined Buildspace

To bring this vision to life, I joined Buildspace, a collaborative online platform that offers invaluable resources and support for aspiring developers. Here’s why Buildspace is the perfect environment for my project:

1. **Collaborative Community**: Buildspace allows anyone to pitch their project and receive feedback for free. This collaborative spirit can help me refine my ideas and ensure that my website meets the community's needs.
2. **Potential Collaborators**: The platform is a great place to find like-minded individuals who might want to join me in building this deck-building site. Having a team can accelerate development and bring diverse perspectives to the project.
3. **Structured Guidance**: Buildspace offers weekly lectures and labs, providing soft guidance and structure. This can be crucial for maintaining self-discipline and motivation, especially when working on a project of this scale.

### The Technology Stack

Building a robust and user-friendly deck-building website requires a solid technology stack. Here’s what I’m using:

1. **Next.js**: As an open-source web development framework, Next.js is both flexible and easy to use. My previous experience with this framework makes it an ideal choice for the front-end development of the website, especially considering my relative inexperience in this area.
2. **ExpressoTS**: This relatively new open-source Node.js framework is designed for creating highly maintainable server-side applications. ExpressoTS aims to streamline the developer experience while remaining flexible. It’s similar to Nest.js but allows for an un-opinionated folder structure, which I find beneficial for organizing my code.
3. **Supabase**: An open-source backend as a service, Supabase simplifies deployment and offers a managed Postgres database, authentication, and storage. The free tier of Supabase is perfect for my needs, given the small size of the Western Cookie Run: Braverse community. The 50,000 active monthly users limit should be more than sufficient.

### Conclusion

By leveraging the resources and community at Buildspace, and using a carefully chosen technology stack, I aim to build a deck-building website that will greatly benefit the Western Cookie Run: Braverse community. This project not only addresses a significant gap but also combines my love for the game with my passion for software development. I’m excited to see how this journey unfolds and to provide a valuable tool for fellow fans.
